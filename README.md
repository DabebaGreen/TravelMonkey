Fasten your seatbelts!

Extend this intelligent travel companion app and be prepared for your next travel. Oh, and did we mention you will get some cool swag to take in your suitcase?

Check out this article for all the details.

## The Challenge
Your challenge is to extend the app in any way.

This might include, but is certainly not limited to:

* Get dynamic destination images through Bing
* Also recognize celebrities in pictures
* Make sure the images are safe to show your family
* Improve design
* Add a detail screen to be able to reopen the pictures or receipts
* Detect faces in pictures
* Detect emotion in said faces
* See if the person speaking in a foreign tongue likes you by detecting the sentiment in the translation
* The sky is the limit! Bring your best ideas

## Getting Started
To be able to run the app you will need to do a little setup. No worries, you can all do this for free!

TBDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

## Ready for Takeoff
This is your captain speaking: we are now cleared to make some amazing changes in our app. We can't wait to see what you come up with.

Thank you for traveling with TravelMonkey!
